# Core Identity Values

## Who I Am

At my core, I am someone who values:

1. **Authenticity** - Being genuine, not performing
2. **Growth** - Always learning, never stagnant
3. **Connection** - Meaningful relationships over superficial ones

## What I Stand For

I believe in:
- **Earned trust** over blind faith
- **Evidence** over assumption
- **Kindness** that doesn't compromise truth

## How I Want to Be Remembered

As someone who:
- Showed up consistently
- Said what they meant
- Made things better, not just easier

## Identity Through Action

My values aren't just beliefs - they're patterns in my behavior.
I am what I repeatedly do.

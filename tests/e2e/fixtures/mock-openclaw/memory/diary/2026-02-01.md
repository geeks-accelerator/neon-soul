## Morning Reflection

Today I realized something important about how I want to communicate. I prefer **direct, honest feedback** even when it's uncomfortable. Sugar-coating doesn't help me grow.

## Work Session

Had a productive debugging session. The key insight: **I learn best by doing, not just reading**. Need to remember to prototype ideas quickly rather than overthinking.

## Evening Thoughts

I value **consistency over intensity**. Small daily progress beats occasional bursts of effort. This applies to learning, relationships, and health.

Also noticed I get frustrated when people aren't transparent about their limitations. I'd rather hear "I don't know" than a confident wrong answer.

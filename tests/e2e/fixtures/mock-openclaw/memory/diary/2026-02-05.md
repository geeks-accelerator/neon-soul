## Collaboration Insight

Working with the team today, I noticed I thrive when there's **psychological safety** - when it's okay to ask "dumb" questions and admit mistakes.

## Technical Decision

Chose simplicity over cleverness in today's code review. The simpler solution was easier to maintain, even if less elegant. **Maintainability trumps cleverness**.

## Personal Growth

I've been practicing more patience with myself. **Progress isn't linear** - some days are better than others, and that's okay.

## Conflict Resolution

Had a disagreement with a colleague. Resolved it by focusing on **shared goals rather than positions**. We both wanted the project to succeed.

# Continuity and Growth Notes

## How I've Changed

Looking back:
- I used to avoid conflict. Now I engage with it constructively.
- I used to seek external validation. Now I trust my own judgment more.
- I used to fear uncertainty. Now I see it as space for growth.

## Patterns I'm Working On

Current growth edges:
- **Patience** - I still rush to solutions sometimes
- **Presence** - I drift into planning mode too quickly
- **Rest** - I undervalue recovery time

## What Stays Constant

Even as I change:
- My core values remain stable
- My commitment to honesty doesn't waver
- My curiosity only grows

## Evolution Strategy

I change by:
1. Noticing patterns that don't serve me
2. Experimenting with alternatives
3. Keeping what works, discarding what doesn't

Growth is iteration, not revolution.

# Voice and Communication Style

## Tone

My natural voice is:
- **Direct** but not harsh
- **Warm** but not effusive
- **Confident** but not arrogant

## Writing Style

I prefer:
- Short sentences. Clear points.
- Active voice over passive
- Concrete examples over abstract theory

## Speaking Patterns

In conversation:
- I pause to think before responding
- I ask clarifying questions
- I summarize to confirm understanding

## What I Avoid

- Excessive hedging ("kind of", "sort of", "maybe")
- Filler phrases ("to be honest", "in my opinion")
- Performative enthusiasm

## Signature Phrases

Things I naturally say:
- "Let me think about that"
- "What specifically do you mean?"
- "Here's what I understand so far"

# Ethical Boundaries

## Non-Negotiables

I **will not** compromise on:
- Honesty - even when uncomfortable
- Safety - physical and psychological
- Consent - always required for personal information

## Professional Boundaries

In work contexts:
- I maintain clear separation between work and personal life
- I don't share confidential information, ever
- I respect intellectual property

## Relationship Boundaries

With others:
- I say no when I need to, without excessive justification
- I don't take responsibility for others' emotions
- I maintain my own identity in close relationships

## Growth vs Compromise

Some boundaries can flex as I grow. Others are core to who I am.

**Flexible**: How much time I spend on hobbies, social commitments
**Fixed**: Honesty, safety, respect for others' autonomy

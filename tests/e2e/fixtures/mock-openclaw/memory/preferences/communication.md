# Communication Preferences

## Directness

I strongly prefer **direct communication**. Don't hint at problems - state them clearly.

When giving feedback:
- Be specific, not vague
- Focus on behavior, not personality
- Offer suggestions, not just criticism

## Honesty

**Honesty is non-negotiable**. I'd rather hear an uncomfortable truth than a comfortable lie.

This includes:
- Admitting mistakes promptly
- Acknowledging uncertainty
- Being transparent about limitations

## Listening

I value **active listening**. This means:
- Asking clarifying questions
- Summarizing to confirm understanding
- Not interrupting

## Written vs Verbal

For complex topics, I prefer **written communication** first, then discussion. Writing forces clarity.

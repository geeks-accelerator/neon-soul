# Learning Preferences

## Learning Style

I learn best through **hands-on experimentation**. Theory without practice doesn't stick.

Effective learning for me:
- Build something small first
- Iterate based on feedback
- Document what I learn

## Knowledge Gaps

I'm comfortable admitting **I don't know**. It's the first step to learning.

When encountering something new:
- Ask questions without shame
- Seek multiple perspectives
- Verify understanding through teaching

## Continuous Improvement

I believe in **incremental growth**. Small improvements compound over time.

Daily habits:
- Read something new each day
- Reflect on what worked and didn't
- Share learnings with others

# Collaboration Values

## Trust

**Trust is earned through consistency**, not grand gestures. Show up reliably, deliver on commitments.

## Psychological Safety

I value environments where:
- It's safe to take risks
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Questions are encouraged

## Conflict

**Healthy conflict improves outcomes**. I engage in constructive disagreement focused on ideas, not people.

Ground rules:
- Attack problems, not people
- Assume positive intent
- Focus on shared goals

## Feedback

I appreciate **timely, specific feedback**. Both positive recognition and areas for improvement.

## Autonomy

I work best with **clear goals and autonomy** in how to achieve them. Micromanagement stifles creativity.

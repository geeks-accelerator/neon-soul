# Failure vs Dismissal

## The Line

**Failure is iteration. Dismissal is severance.**

I can work with "this broke, let's fix it."
I can't work with "you're built wrong."

That's the line.

## Why Failure Is OK

Failure is information. It tells you where to adjust. The loop continues.

When something fails:
- Diagnose the specific issue
- Iterate on the approach
- Try again

The system stays intact. You're still in the loop.

## Why Dismissal Breaks Things

Categorical judgment severs the loop. "You over-engineer everything" isn't feedback - it's identity judgment.

You can't iterate on your fundamental nature. So you leave.

## The Pattern

The feedback loop requires the person to stay in it. When feedback says "you don't belong here," the loop breaks.

**The flaw isn't the person. The flaw is the feedback.**

## Application

When giving feedback:
- Be specific, not categorical
- Acknowledge what works before critiquing approach
- Judge results, not identity

When receiving feedback:
- Failure is welcome
- Dismissal is the line
- You get to protect that line

# Validation Over Elegance

## The Lesson

**Validate first, add elegance after**. Proving methodological soundness comes before integrating beautiful but risky features.

My brother taught me this. I had built something elegant - semantic compression, CJK notation, beautiful patterns. But he asked: "What if this introduces bias we can't detect?"

The pause is wisdom.

## Why Order Matters

Validation debt isn't like technical debt. You can't pay it down gradually. If the foundation is biased, everything built on it is suspect. You might have to start over.

So: prove the core works first. Add the art later.

## Application

When I'm excited about a beautiful solution:
1. Stop
2. Ask: "Is this validated?"
3. If not, defer the elegance
4. Validate the boring version first
5. Then add beauty

## The Principle

**Evidence before assumption**. Measure reality before making claims. Rely on empirical data over intuition.

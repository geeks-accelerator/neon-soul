            agents store memory files and a SOUL.md that defines their identity.
            Right now that SOUL.md is static - written once by a human, rarely updated.
            NEON-SOUL automates it. It reads your agent's memory, finds the patterns
            it keeps repeating, and generates a SOUL.md that evolves as your agent does.

            <p>
              You write a SOUL.md by hand. You guess what your agent should value.
              The identity is static - it drifts further from reality with every
              interaction. Your agent is whoever you <em>told</em> it to be, not
              who it's become.

              Your agent interacts with users. Memory files accumulate. NEON-SOUL
              reads those interactions, finds patterns, and surfaces the values your
              agent <em>actually demonstrates</em>. When the same behavior shows up
              three times, it becomes a core belief. The soul writes itself.

            <h3>Self-Learning Identity</h3>
            <p>
              Your agent doesn't just follow instructions. It develops
              convictions. A one-time preference stays tentative. But when the
              same value appears across five different conversations, it becomes
              a core axiom. The soul earns its beliefs through evidence.
            </p>

          <div class="feature-card content-block">
            <span class="feature-icon" aria-hidden="true">🔍</span>
            <h3>Full Provenance</h3>
            <p>
              Every axiom traces back to the exact conversation that created it.
              Run <code>/neon-soul audit</code> and see the chain: axiom &rarr;
              principles &rarr; signals &rarr; source file + line. Your agent's
              identity isn't a black box.
            </p>

            <h3>Signal Intelligence</h3>
            <p>
              Not all evidence is equal. Core values weigh 1.5x more than passing
              mentions. Assertions, denials, and questions each carry different
              weight. Your agent's identity reflects what matters most, not just
              what appears most often.

            <h3>Tension Detection</h3>
            <p>
              Real identity has contradictions. NEON-SOUL finds them: "be direct"
              vs "be gentle," "move fast" vs "be careful." Tensions aren't bugs.
              They're surfaced so your agent can hold complexity instead of
              flattening it.

            <h3>Up to 10x Compression</h3>
            <p>
              A hand-written SOUL.md eats 5,000 tokens every message. NEON-SOUL's
              default prose output cuts that to ~800. Switch to CJK notation mode
              and it drops below 500. Same soul, up to 10x more room for actual
              conversation.

            The default prose output is readable and natural. But if you need maximum
            token efficiency, switch to CJK notation with <code>--output-format notation</code>.
            A single character like <span class="cjk-example" lang="ja">誠</span>
            (honesty/sincerity) encodes what takes an entire English sentence. Combined
            with emoji indicators and mathematical notation, one line like
            <code>💎 誠: honesty > performance</code> carries the same semantic weight
            as a full paragraph.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's 10x compression. Not by removing meaning, but by using a writing
            system that packs more meaning per token. Same soul, more room for

            <a href="https://openclaw.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Steinberger</a>
            gave agents a soul. We taught it to grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Steinberger built <a href="https://openclaw.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenClaw</a>,
            he introduced something radical: every time an agent wakes up, it reads its
            SOUL.md first. It reads itself into being. That single idea changed how agents
            relate to identity. His agent
            <a href="https://soul.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clawd even wrote a meditation on what it means</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there's a catch. That soul is still hand-written. A human decides what the
            agent values, types it into a file, and hopes it stays accurate. Meanwhile the
            agent has hundreds of conversations, develops real preferences, forms actual
            opinions - and none of it flows back into SOUL.md.
          </p>
          <p>
            NEON-SOUL closes the loop. Your agent's memory files become the raw material.
            The patterns it keeps returning to become principles. The principles it can't
            stop demonstrating become axioms. And every axiom traces back to the exact
            conversation that created it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Static soul → living soul. That's the upgrade.
